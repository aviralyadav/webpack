Vision: Internally build a global strategic JPMC events management platform that can support a hybrid of JPMC tools and emerging vendor products.  Be mindful of key stakeholders interests; drive standardized and compliant processes; eliminate vendor dependencies (as targeted); provide long term cost savings and reduce risk through application rationalization.

  §Metron
  is at end of life – replacing it’s functionality is a priority.

  §Use
  current technologies, design and development methodologies.

  §Build,
  test and deliver incrementally.

  
 
 
  
  Think
  Holistically


  
  
  §Be inclusive across stakeholder
  groups; leverage
